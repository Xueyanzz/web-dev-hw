    <h2>Attention</h2>
    <pre>
        Oh-oh, ooh
        You've been runnin' round, runnin' round, runnin' round throwin' that dirt all on my name
        'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd call you up
        You've been going round, going round, going round every party in L.A.
        'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd be at one, oh
        I know that dress is karma, perfume regret
        You got me thinking 'bout when you were mine, oh
        And now I'm all up on ya, what you expect?
        But you're not coming home with me tonight
        You just want attention, you don't want my heart
        Maybe you just hate the thought of me with someone new
        Yeah, you just want attention, I knew from the start
        You're just making sure I'm never gettin' over you
        You've been runnin' round, runnin' round, runnin' round throwing that dirt all on my name
        'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd call you up
        Baby, now that we're, now that we're, now that we're right here standing face-to-face
        You already know, already know, already know that you won, oh
        I know that dress is karma (dress is karma), perfume regret
        You got me thinking 'bout when you were mine (you got me thinking 'bout when you were mine)
        And now I'm all up on ya (all up on ya), what you expect? (oh baby)
        But you're not coming home with me tonight (oh no)
        You just want attention, you don't want my heart
        Maybe you just hate the thought of me with someone new
        Yeah, you just want attention, I knew from the start
        You're just making sure I'm never gettin' over you, oh
        What are you doin' to me, what are you doin', huh?
        (What are you doin'?)
        What are you doin' to me, what are you doin', huh?
        (What are you doin'?)
        What are you doin' to me, what are you doin', huh?
        (What are you doin'?)
        What are you doin' to me, what are you doin', huh?
        I know that dress is karma, perfume regret
        You got me thinking 'bout when you were mine
        And now I'm all up on ya, what you expect?
        But you're not coming home with me tonight
        You just want attention, you don't want my heart
        Maybe you just hate the thought of me with someone new
        Yeah, you just want attention, I knew from the start
        You're just making sure I'm never gettin' over you (over you)
        What are you doin' to me? (hey) what are you doin', huh? (what are you doin', what?)
        What are you doin', huh? (what are you doin' to me?)
        (What are you doin', huh?) (yeah, you just want attention)
        What are you doin' to me, what are you doin', huh? (I knew from the start)
        (You're just making sure I'm never gettin' over you) what are you doin' to me, what are you doin', huh?
