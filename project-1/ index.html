<hr />

  <p>When you are old and grey and full of sleep,</p>
  <p>And nodding by the fireï¼Œtake down this book,</p>
  <p>And slowly read,and dream of the soft look,</p>
  <p>Your eyes had once,and of their shadows deep;</p>
  <p>How many loved your moments of glad grace,</p>
  <p>And loved your beauty with love false or true,</p>
  <p>But one man loved the pilgrim Soul in you,</p>
  <p>And loved the sorrows of your changing face;</p>
  <p>And bending down beside the glowing bars,</p>
  <p>Murmur,a little sadly,how Love fled,</p>
  <p>And paced upon the mountains overhead </p>
  <p>And hid his face amid a crowd of stars.</p>
