           <h1>What is Ma Po Tofu</h1>
           <p>If you know the Chinese name of Mapo tofu(麻婆豆腐), the answer might be tofu made by mapo or is mapo is kind of flavor. At the very beginning, Mapo tofu is named after its creator.
              It is recorded that there is a couple who own a restaurant mainly selling vegetarian dishes. The wife also the cook gets some pock (麻子in Chinese)on her face. Her tofu dishes are quite popular among the guests. However some guests told her that they want to eat some meat rather than just tofu. So she bought some beef and cut it to granules and adding the beef into her tofu. Then the tofu dish with beef become more popular and her guests gave the name: Mapo tofu.Nowadays, along with the popular of this dish, there are many variations for example vegetarian version or pork version. Besides, mapo has becomes a kind of flavor which has also been used in other dishes.From the healthy consideration, tofu or bean curd is considered as one of the most nourishing cooking ingredients. There are many types of tofu product on market from soft tofu to firm tofu, from tofu skin to dried tofu etc. Surely, the cooking methods actually depend on the texture of the ingredients. For marinating, soft tofu is more fitful than firm tofu and for stir-frying and deep frying, firm tofu is better than soft tofu.

  <h2>Why do I want to tell you about this traditional Sichuan Cuisine?</h2>
  <p>
    I am a foreign student who's from Sichuan, the South-West of China. Sichuan occupied most of the Sichuan Basin and the easternmost part of the Tibetan Plateau between the Jinsha River on the west, the Daba Mountains in the north, and the Yungui Plateau to the south.
    Under the Köppen climate classification, the Sichuan Basin in the eastern half of the province experiences a humid subtropical climate, with long, hot, wet summers and short, mild to cool, dry and cloudy winters. Consequently, it has China's lowest sunshine totals.
    The climate makes Sichuan people like eating pungent and spicy food, and the Ma Po Tofu combines the pungent of Sichuan Pepper, the spicy of Chilis, which are the spirit of Sichuan Cuisine.
    Ma Po Toufu is a typical Sichuan Cuisine. And it is the taste of my hometown.
